## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```
Replace `<repository-url>` with your project's repository URL.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install all the required npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Firebase

This project uses Firebase for authentication and database services. You'll need to create your own Firebase project to run it locally.

1.  **Create a Firebase Project:** Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2.  **Create a Web App:** Inside your project, create a new Web App. Firebase will provide you with a configuration object.
3.  **Enable Services:**
    *   Go to the **Authentication** section and enable the "Email/Password" sign-in method.
    *   Go to the **Firestore Database** section and create a new database. Start in **test mode** for easy setup (you can secure it later with the provided `firestore.rules`).
4.  **Create Environment File:** Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project. Copy your Firebase configuration credentials into this file like so:

    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID
    ```
    You can find these values in your Firebase project settings under "Your apps" > "Web app" > "SDK setup and configuration".

### 4. Run the Development Server

Now, you can start the local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:9002` (or another port if 9002 is in use).
